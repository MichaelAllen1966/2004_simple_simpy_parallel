    "* *Hospital*: A class for hospital objects. Has a given number of beds. The hospital class allocates beds to patients on a priority basis. It holds the queue for patients waiting for beds, and lists (by patient priority) of queue times each patient has waited for a bed. It has an audit method which monitors the number of patients in beds or waiting for beds each day.\n",

    "1. The `Model` object sets up a `SimPy` environment and a `Hospital` object. It initiates processes which generate `Patient` objects (from within the `Model`), and which audit patients in beds or waiting for beds (in the `Hospital`). `Patients`, as they are generated, are passed to the `Hospital` for allocation to beds.\n",
    "1. At the end of the run, the `Model` summaries statistics for patients waiting for beds, or in beds, and for queue times by patient priority.\n"
