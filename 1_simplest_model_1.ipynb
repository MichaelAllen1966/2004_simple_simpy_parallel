    "# A simple (non-objected-based) SimPy model of an ED unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following model shows a very simple SimPy model, and contains the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "*generate_patient_arrivals*: A SimPy process that generates patients every 15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*patient_ed_stay*: A SimPy process for a pateint staying at ED for 30-120 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*main*: Model run. This 1) Sets up model environment, 2) Initialise processes needed at model start, and 3) Start model with required model duration\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: All SimPy processes must be called with `env.process` in addition to the process function/method name. Handy hint: If you get the error `function_x is not a generator` it may be because you have mised the `()` after the function in the process call (I do this at least once every model build)."
